# DSA

---

## Benefits of Understanding DSA
- Learn to think algorithmically: break problems down into easier-to-solve parts
- Learn to think about how to organise data for more efficient access.
- Learn and practice performance optimisation

## What is a Data Structure?
- Data structures are just organisational tools that allow for more advanced algorithms. Some very primitive data structure examples (Python) are:
    - **Lists**: Ordered collections of data
    - **Dictionaries**: Key -> value map
    - **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique data

## What is an algorithm?
- An algorithm is a set of instructions that can be carried out to solve a problem. Practically ever function that is written in code is an algorithm, even if it's a simple one.
