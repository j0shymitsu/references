    <h1>Linus Benedict Torvalds</h1>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds (born 28 December 1969) is a Finnish software engineer who is the creator and lead developer of the Linux kernel. He also created the distributed version control system Git.</p>
        <h3>Life and career</h3>
            <h4>Early years</h4>
                <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. His interest in computers began with a VIC-20 at the age of 11 in 1981. He started programming for it in BASIC, then later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (he did not utilize assembly language). He then purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system.</p>
            <h4>Linux</h4>
                <p>The first Linux prototypes were publicly released on the Internet in late 1991 from an FTP server at his university. Version 1.0 was released on 14 March 1994. Torvalds would ultimately switch his original license (which forbade commercial use) to Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel. After a visit to Transmeta in late 1996, Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he worked from February 1997 to June 2003. He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs. The Linux Foundation currently sponsors Torvalds so he can work full-time on improving Linux.</p>
        <h3>Authority and trademark</h3>
                <p>As of 2006, approximately 2% of the Linux kernel was written by Torvalds himself. Despite the thousands who have contributed to it, his percentage is still one of the largest. However, he said in 2012 that his own personal contribution is now mostly merging code written by others, with little programming. He retains the highest authority to decide which new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel. Torvalds holds the Linux trademark and monitors its use, chiefly through the Linux Mark Institute</p>
        <h3>Other Software</h3>
            <h4>Git</h4>
                <p>On 3 April 2005, Torvalds began development on Git, version control software that later became widely used. On 26 July 2005, he turned over Git's maintenance to Junio Hamano, a major project contributor. </p>
            <h4>Subsurface</h4>
                <p>Subsurface is software for logging and planning scuba dives, which Torvalds began developing in late 2011. It is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. Dirk Hohndel became its head maintainer in late 2012.</p>
